# Lab 02 Opportunity Scanning
## Ideas Reviewed from Lab 1
| Idea | Problem Area | Target User | Current Alternative | Initial Technology Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idea 1: SmartTimetable | Students and lecturers have no unified, real-time source for class schedules, room assignments, and last-minute changes | Students, lecturers, and staff | PDF timetables, LINE group chats, word-of-mouth updates | Web application with cloud database and LINE Notify alerts |
| Idea 2: MentalCare | Students face academic stress and emotional difficulty but lack a low-barrier way to check in on their wellbeing or find support | Students; secondarily, counselors and welfare staff | In-person visits to the counseling center; no digital tracking option | Web application with anonymous check-in and cloud database |
| Idea 3: EventHub | Campus event promotion is fragmented across social media and LINE, causing students to miss events they'd want to attend | Students, student clubs, and faculty units as organizers | Individual Facebook/Instagram posts and LINE group announcements | Web application with admin posting interface and RSVP system |
| Idea 4: PeerNote | Students who miss class or struggle to keep up have no structured way to access organized, searchable lecture notes | Students | Informal photo/PDF sharing in LINE chats and personal Drive links | Web application with file upload, tagging, and search |
| Idea 5: QuickPoll | Lecturers get no real-time feedback on student understanding, and students are uncomfortable signaling confusion aloud | Lecturers and students | End-of-semester evaluation forms; raising hands in class | Web application with anonymous live polling and real-time results |
| Idea 6: LinguaHub | Students lack consistent, low-pressure opportunities to practice English speaking and writing | Students, especially non-native English speakers | Informal practice with friends, classroom participation only | Web application with peer matching and scheduling |

## Scoring Matrix
 
| Idea | New | Useful | Feasible | Total | Rank | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idea 1: SmartTimetable | 4 | 5 | 5 | 14 | 1 | Chosen venture direction: solves a daily, universal problem for the whole university with high feasibility using standard web + database skills already covered in coursework |
| Idea 2: MindCare | 4 | 5 | 5 | 14 | 1 | Anonymous design removes auth complexity; simple check-in form makes it very feasible |
| Idea 3: EventHub | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 3 | Useful but similar to existing social media use; very feasible as basic CRUD app |
| Idea 4: PeerNotes | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 3 | Simple file upload and search system; low technical risk, high feasibility |
| Idea 5: QuickPoll | 4 | 4 | 4 | 12 | 3 | Novel use case for RSU classrooms; needs real-time updates, slightly more complex |
| Idea 6: LinguaHub | 4 | 4 | 3 | 11 | 6 | Differentiated idea with AI feedback angle; matching plus AI integration adds moderate complexity |
